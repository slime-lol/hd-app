Note: I'm not the best UI designer, although the UI is the main selling point of this script ðŸ˜¥

This is a decent recreation of the loading screen from PaRappa the Rapper 2, and I thought it would be the first test of my coding skills.

Total Experience (at time of wrtiting script): 12 months\n
Time taken to write whole code: 90 minutes

Smaller details excluded as they would add unnecessary padding to the code itself

(i had this in my folder of rbxl files for three months)
